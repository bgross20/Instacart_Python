# Instacart_Python
A data analysis project for CareerFoundry using Python to analyze data from an online shopping app, Instacart.

## Background 

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, has good sales, but wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

## Objectives and Key Questions 

As a data analyst for Instacart, my task was to to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. 

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

    ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
    often do they return to Instacart)?

    ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

    ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

    ○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
    habits?

    ○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
    Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

    ○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
    profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
    customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data

Multiple Excel CSV files that were provided and edited by CareerFoundry from its original source: https://kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis

## Tools
Language: Python 
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, mathplotlib, seaborn, scipy 
Software: Jupyter notebooks, Excel 

## Skills Demonstrated 

**Wrangling and Cleaning Data:** dropped columns, renamed columns, addressed mixed or incorrect data types, found and addressed missing values, and removed duplicates

**Merging Data:** Selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed merge was successful, and exported final merge as a pickle file. 

**Exploratory Analysis:** Explored basic descriptive statistics (max, min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable. Also used histograms, scatterplots, bar, and line charges to explore the distributions of data. 

**Derived New Variables:** Created new variables using if-statements, loc() function, and for-loops. New variables such as mariatal status and dependent status were created. Confirmed new data created via crosstables and value counts. 

**Visualizing Data:** Used Mathplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts 

**Reporting Results:** Provided an Excel file that explained answers to questions from sales/marketing as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
